# Initialize AI
ai = CodeTutorAI()

# Learn from tutorial text
result = ai.learn_from_tutorial_text("""
Python functions are defined with 'def'. They can take parameters 
and return values. Example: def add(a, b): return a + b
""", language="python")

# Generate code explanation
explanation = ai.generate_code_explanation("""
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
""")

print(explanation['explanation'])
```

### 2. **Web Interface**
```bash
python web_app.py
