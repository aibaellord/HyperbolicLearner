"""
Knowledge Graph Database Module for HyperbolicLearner

This module implements a sophisticated graph database for storing, querying, and analyzing 
knowledge entities and their relationships extracted from tutorial videos. It represents 
concepts, actions, UI elements, and their interconnections as a comprehensive knowledge graph.

Features:
- Advanced node and edge typing system with hierarchical relationships
- Optimized storage with automatic serialization/deserialization
- Powerful query engine with pattern matching and semantic search
- Transaction support with atomicity guarantees
- Visualization capabilities for knowledge exploration
- Statistical analysis of knowledge relationships
- Automatic validation and integrity checking
- Export/import functionality for knowledge sharing
- Version control for tracking knowledge evolution
