## ðŸ”§ **WHAT NEEDS TO BE OPTIMIZED FOR FULL POWER**

### **Priority 1: Dependency Optimization (This Week)**

#### **1. Install Missing Power Dependencies**
```bash
# Critical AI dependencies
pip install transformers torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install opencv-python pillow numpy scikit-learn
pip install selenium requests beautifulsoup4
pip install speech-recognition pyaudio librosa

# Database & Storage
pip install redis asyncpg elasticsearch
pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets

# Advanced ML
pip install sentence-transformers diffusers accelerate
```

#### **2. Fix Import Dependencies**
Current issue: Some modules reference advanced features that need optional imports.

**Solution:**
```python
# Make all advanced features optional with graceful fallbacks
try:
    from transformers import BlipProcessor
    VISION_MODEL_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    VISION_MODEL_AVAILABLE = False
    # Use basic functionality
```

#### **3. Configuration Optimization**
```bash
# Create optimized config files
mkdir -p config/{security,api,monitoring}

# Set up environment variables
export HYPERBOLIC_ENV=production
export PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1
```

### **Priority 2: Module Integration (Next Week)**

#### **1. Master Controller Enhancement**
- Connect all 12 modules properly
- Implement module health monitoring  
- Add performance metrics collection
- Enable real-time status dashboard

#### **2. Inter-Module Communication**
- Set up message queues between modules
- Implement event-driven architecture
- Add module dependency management
- Create unified logging system

#### **3. Data Pipeline Optimization**
- Set up Redis for caching
- Implement database connections
- Add data persistence layers
- Create backup and recovery systems
