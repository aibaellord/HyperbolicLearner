# HyperbolicLearner Deepfake Platform: Technical Architecture

## 1. Modular, Scalable Architecture
- **Input Handler**: Accepts images, videos, and configuration from users (web, API, CLI).
- **Preprocessing Agent**: Detects, tracks, and segments faces/heads in video frames.
- **Knowledge-Driven Orchestrator**: Uses the knowledge graph to guide all downstream processing (context, lighting, emotion, ethics).
- **Face Swap & Synthesis Engine**: Advanced GANs/diffusion models for hyper-realistic, temporally consistent face swaps.
- **Audio Sync & Emotion Transfer Agent**: Ensures lip sync and emotional alignment with video/audio.
- **Multi-Source Fusion Module**: Blends features from multiple images for realism and consistency.
- **Quality Control & Validation Suite**: Ensemble of deepfake detectors, artifact analyzers, and explainable AI modules.
- **Ethics & Security Layer**: Consent management, watermarking, traceability, compliance checks.
- **Continuous Learning & Meta-Learning Loop**: Tracks errors, feedback, and detection results to auto-tune the pipeline.
- **Web Dashboard & API**: For job management, previews, feedback, and reporting.

## 2. Core Modules
- **src/agents/deepfake_preprocessor.py**: Face/feature detection, tracking, segmentation.
- **src/agents/deepfake_synthesizer.py**: Face swap, GAN/diffusion model integration, multi-source fusion.
- **src/agents/audio_sync_agent.py**: Lip sync, emotion transfer, audio-driven animation.
- **src/agents/validation_agent.py**: Deepfake detection, artifact analysis, explainable AI.
- **src/agents/ethics_agent.py**: Consent, watermarking, compliance.
- **src/core/orchestrator.py**: Knowledge-driven orchestration, meta-learning, agent coordination.
- **src/ui/web_interface.py**: Dashboard, job management, user feedback.

## 3. Data Flow
1. User uploads image(s) and video.
2. Preprocessing agent segments and tracks faces.
3. Orchestrator queries knowledge graph for context.
4. Synthesizer swaps faces, guided by context.
5. Audio sync agent aligns lips/emotion.
6. Validation agent checks quality, realism, and ethics.
7. Output is watermarked, traced, and delivered via dashboard/API.
8. Feedback and results are used to improve the system.

## 4. Continuous Improvement
- Auto-benchmarking against new datasets and attacks.
- User and system feedback loops.
- Knowledge graph updates and meta-learning for pipeline optimization.
